## The idea

I've worked on a ton of different boards ranging from keyboards, to motherboards to hackathon badges to even carriers, but now I want to work on something next level.

I've always been fascinated by hybrid computing in a consumer setting and building complicated stuff, so with that in mind, I've come up with my next idea.

FPGA's are becoming much more mainstream for parallelization and computing so I want to explore how hobbyists can leverage this technology in an affordable and cool way.

The thing about FPGA's, is while they're really useful, it's hard to make practical applications of them as a hobbyist, because it's not like you're going to innovate the next big chip or something, but that's where I want to leverage the fact that FPGA's aren't just useful for mainstream chips, but also more niche applications like very specific hardware acceleration, that consumers can actually make cool use of and practice.

So the idea is simple, I want a low-cost way, hobbyists can make practical applications of FPGA's in a bunch of different settings.

To do this, I want to provide an FPGA devboard of sorts, that can interface with your computer hardware so you can practice on real-world applications in more niche settings. But I want to go a step further and also make it function as a standard devboard in case you don't have access to an M.2 slot, so I need to break out like standard USB-C and whatnot.

This also means that I want to add other functions like HDMI, maybe even GbE and just generally make it insanely useful to hobbyiests!

There's a couple key goals I have for this project:
- Learn to route BGA and high-density impedance controlled traces
- Learn ethernet, HDMI and PCIe routing
- Understand at a better fundamental level, how the fields are interacting in higher speed applications
- Pay much more attention to what's actually happening and learn more about the high level physics
